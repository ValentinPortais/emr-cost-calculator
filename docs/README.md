## EMR Cost Calculator

#### A simple python module that calculates the cost of a single or a group of EMR clusters.

Given that Amazon doesn’t provide a straightforward solution to calculate the cost of an EMR workflow, this module aims to calculate the cost of an EMR workflow given a period of days,
or the cost of a single cluster given the cluster id. The simple way to do that would be to use the information given by the JobFLow method of the boto.emr module. However, this method
doesn’t return any information about the Task nodes of a cluster, and whether or not spot instances were used.

This cost calculator takes care of both. In case spot instances were used, the spot_price is retrieved by the corresponding field of the InstanceGroup emrobject. This figure corersponds
to the bidprice and this is the price we use in order to calculate the total cost. In many cases however (and depending on your bidding policy) this might not be the final price that you
pay for the instances (for more information about the amazon spot instance market check [here] (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/spot-instances/)). Since the price that we pay
is the current minimum bidprice (that has been granted instances) a more accurate approach would require to monitor the minimum bid price while the cluster is alive and adjust the cluster cost
accordingly. However, this approach adds a lot of complexity and in case that your bidding prices are not extremely higher than the minimum bid price, our current approach is accurate enough.

### How it works

This module is using [docopt](http://docopt.org/) in order to parse command line arguments.

It currently support two operations:

1. Get the total cost of an EMR worfklow for a given period of days
  * `emr_cost_calculator.py total --region=<The region you launched your clusters in> --created_after=<YYYY-MM-DD> --created_before=<YYYY-MM-DD>`

2. Get the cost of an EMR cluster given the cluster id
  * `emr_cost_calculator.py cluster --region=<The region you launched your clusters in> --cluster_id=<j-xxxxxxxxxxxx>`

In both cases the aws_access_key_id and the aws_secret_access_key, which are required to connect to the AWS EMR API,
can be passed as parameters to the script. Alternatively, you can set the environment variables:

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Your AWS Access Key ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Your AWS Secret Access Key`

#### On demand prices

Since Amazon doesn’t provide the on_demand prices for each instance type through an API, the only way to dynamically retrieving those prices would be to scrape the Amazon website.
for convenience, and since those prices do not change very often, we chose to store them in a yaml file. this list is not complete and only contains the instance types that we
were interested in.
